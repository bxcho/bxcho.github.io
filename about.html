  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm currently a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science and Economics with a passion for strategy, product, and data. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and business.</p>
  <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy any physical activity and eating. This would be gym, calisthenics, golf, tennis, and basketball, along with my favorite soft tofu stew and AYCE Korean barbecues.</p>
  <p>I have a passion for community service and take initiative whenever I find the chance, whether it be picking up plastic bits and cigarette butts or tutoring my neighbors' kids.</p>
